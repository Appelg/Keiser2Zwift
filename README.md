# Keiser2Zwift

Use your Keiser M3 bike with apps like Zwift without buying a converter from Keiser which never really worked for me.  This project was built to use make use of a Raspberry pi
with 2 bluetooth adapters.  Other system may work but your on your own to get it setup.  Two bluetooth adapters are required to make this work.  I use the built in one on a Raspberry Pi 3/4 or the Pi Zero W
and an additional one plugged into the usb port.   The steps to install are below.

# USB bluetooth adapters known to work
Any one available from Amazon with linux support should work but I have tried these:
